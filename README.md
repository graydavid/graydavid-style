## Adding this project to your build

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). It's currently available via the Maven snapshot repository only as version 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT. The "0.0.1" part is because it's still in development, waiting for feedback or sufficient usage until its first official release. The "SNAPSHOT" part is because no one has requested a stable, non-SNAPSHOT development version. If you need a non-SNAPSHOT development version, feel free to reach out, and I can build this project into the Maven central repository.
